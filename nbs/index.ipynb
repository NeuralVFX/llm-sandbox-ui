    "#### This project has two components:\n",
    "- Web-Interface: [unreal-llm-sandbox](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/unreal-llm-sandbox)  <--- You are here\n",
    "- Unreal Plugin: [unreal-llm-sandbox-plugin](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/unreal-llm-sandbox-plugin)\n",
    "  \n",
    "# What is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Unreal Engine plugin that exposes a Python execution server, enabling:\n",
    "- A web-based coding interface connected directly to Unreal\n",
    "- LLM-assisted code review with full context of your code and errors\n",
    "- Creation and deployment of agentic tools that operate inside the engine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- **Code Execution** - All Code is executed directly in Unreal Engine\n",
    "- **LLM Execution** - Ask an LLM for help, with your code/errors in context\n",
    "- **Agentic Tool Use** - LLM can use tools directly in Unreal Engine\n",
    "- **User Tools** - Build and register custom agentic tools instantly\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone and Install\n",
    "Create a new `conda` env, then:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/NeuralVFX/unreal-llm-sandbox \n",
    "cd unreal-llm-sandbox\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`\n",
    "In Windows, open `Powershell` and then:\n",
    "```\n",
    "setx OPENAI_API_KEY *Your_api_key*\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Linux, I bet you'll figure it out...\n",

    "# Unreal Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow instructions at **[unreal-llm-sandbox-unreal](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/unreal-llm-sandbox-unreal)** to install Unreal side\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting the Server\n",
    "\n",
    "From the menu bar:\n",
    "`LLM Sandbox → Start Server`\n",
    "- The server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Starting the Web Interface\n",
    "- Start `unreal-llm-sandbox` from command line ( outside of Unreal )\n",
    "- Open `http://localhost:5001/notebook/notebook.ipynb` ( or any `ipynb` name )\n",
    "- If the notebook doesn't exist, a blank one is created\n",
    "- Notebooks auto-save every 2 seconds\n",
    "- Standard `.ipynb` format, compatible with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app provides:\n",
    "- **Notebook Interface** - Jupyter-style interface\n",
    "- `Code Cells` - Write and executing Python code in Unreal\n",
    "- `Markdown Cells` - Write notes in Markdown\n",
    "- `LLM Prompt Cells` - Chat with LLMs that have full context of your notebook + agentic control of Unreal\n",
    "\n",
    "# Registering Custom Agent Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax to register a new agentic tool:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "@register_tool\n",
    "def spawn_cube(location_x: float, location_y: float, location_z: float):\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        Name of the spawned actor\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    import unreal\n",
    "    # Your Unreal Python code here\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Either:\n",
    "- Run this in a `Code Cell`\n",
    "- Or create a new python file in your project's `Content/Python/tools` directory\n",
    "#### Tool Discovery:\n",
    "- Tools registered in `Code Cells` are instantly availible to the LLM\n",
    "- Tools added to `Content/Python/tools` are discovered on project restart\n",
    "#### To use:\n",
    "- Open a `Prompt Cell`, Click the 🛠️ icon to activate Unreal tools, and write a prompt!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unreal Engine 5.6\n",
    "- A conda env for the web-server\n",
