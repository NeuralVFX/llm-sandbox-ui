    "A plugin for Unreal Engine that provides a Flask server for LLM-powered code execution directly in the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Execution** - All Code is executed directly in Unreal Engine\n",
    "- **LLM Execution** - Ask an LLM for help, with your code/errros in context\n",
    "- **Agentic Tool Use** - LLM can use tools directly in Unreal Engine\n",
    "- **User Tools** - Build and register custom agentic tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/NeuralVFX/unreal-llm-sandbox \n",
    "cd unreal-llm-sandbox\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### Starting the Server ( Unreal )\n",
    "\n",
    "From the menu bar:\n",
    "```\n",
    "LLM Sandbox -> Start Server\n",

    "- The server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Starting the Web Interface\n",
    "- Start `unreal-llm-sandbox` from command line ( outside of Unreal )\n",
    "- Open `http://localhost:5001/notebook/notebook.ipynb` ( or any `ipynb` name )\n",
    "- If the notebook doesn't exist, a blank one is created\n",
    "- Notebooks auto-save every 2 seconds\n",
    "- Standard `.ipynb` format, compatible with Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app provides:\n",
    "- **Notebook Interface** - Jupyter-style interface\n",
    "- `Code Cells` - Write and executing Python code in Unreal\n",
    "- `Markdown Cells` - Write notes in Markdown\n",
    "- `LLM Prompt Cells` - Chat with LLMs that have full context of your notebook + agentic control of Unreal\n",
    "- `Agent Cells` - Agentic code generation with automatic unit testing and iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Registering Custom Agent Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new python file in your project's `Content/Python/tools` directory:\n",
