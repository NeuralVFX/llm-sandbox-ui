LLM Sandbox is a two-part system that links a web-based notebook interface with Unreal Engine,
allowing Python code and LLMs to interact directly with the editor and scene.

#### This project has two components:
- Web-Interface: [llm-sandbox-ui](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/llm-sandbox-ui)   <--- You are here
- Unreal Plugin: [llm-sandbox-unreal](https://github.com/NeuralVFX/llm-sandbox-unreal)
  

Together, the components enable:
- Executing Python code inside Unreal Engine from a web interface
- LLM-assisted interaction with full visibility into code, output, and errors
- Creation and execution of agentic tools that operate directly on Unreal scenes
  
## Documentation

- **[Setup](SETUP.md)** - Install / Initialize (Unreal Specific Instructions)
- **[Notebook Usage](docs/USAGE.md)** - Work with notebooks and cell types
- **[Agent Customization](docs/TOOLS.md)** - Register and extend agentic tools

## Requirements
- Unreal Engine 5.6
- The Web Interface requires the Unreal plugin to be installed and running in order to use notebooks and LLM features.
